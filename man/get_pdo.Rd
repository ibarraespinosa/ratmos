From https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/pdo/:

The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is often described as a long-lived
El Nino-like pattern of Pacific climate variability (Zhang et al. 1997).
As seen with the better-known El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), extremes
in the PDO pattern are marked by widespread variations in the Pacific Basin
and the North American climate. In parallel with the ENSO phenomenon, the
extreme phases of the PDO have been classified as being either warm or cool,
as defined by ocean temperature anomalies in the northeast and tropical Pacific
Ocean. When SSTs are anomalously cool in the interior North Pacific and warm
along the Pacific Coast, and when sea level pressures are below average over
the North Pacific, the PDO has a positive value. W
